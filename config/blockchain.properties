# Blockchain Configuration File
# ===========================
# This configuration file contains essential settings for the blockchain network.
# It can be customized for different environments (dev, test, prod).
# All settings can be overridden via environment variables.

# Mining Configuration
# ------------------
# Mining difficulty determines how hard it is to mine new blocks
# Higher number = more leading zeros required = more difficult
difficulty=4

# Blockchain Settings  
# ------------------
# Hash of the first block in the chain
# This establishes the starting point of the blockchain
genesis_hash=GENESIS_HASH

# Logging Configuration
# -------------------
# Valid levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
# Controls verbosity of log output
log_level=INFO

# Network Settings
# --------------
# Uncomment and modify these values to configure network behavior
# max_block_size: Maximum size of blocks in bytes
# network_port: Port used for P2P communication
# peer_discovery_interval: How often to look for new peers (in ms)
# max_block_size=1000000
# network_port=8080
# peer_discovery_interval=60000 

# Data Persistence Configuration
# ---------------------------
# Settings for saving blockchain data to JSON files
# enabled: Whether to persist chain to disk
# directory: Where to store the data files
# file: Name of the main chain data file
blockchain.persistence.enabled=true
blockchain.persistence.directory=data
blockchain.persistence.file=chain-data.json
